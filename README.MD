# Server Monitoring System

Server Monitoring System is a simple application that monitors server system information in real-time using Node.js, Express, WebSocket, and Systeminformation.

This application gathers information such as CPU usage, RAM usage, disk usage, and network information from the server and sends it to the client over a WebSocket connection. The client then displays this information in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Monitors CPU, RAM, disk usage, and network information in real-time.
- Displays detailed system information such as OS distribution, total and used RAM and disk space.
- Provides notifications if CPU usage reaches a certain threshold.
